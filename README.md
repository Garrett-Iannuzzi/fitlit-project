## Project Details

This pair project was completed in 10 days during Mod 2.  The objective was to
build out a data model to process several data sets and then to create a
dashboard displaying user activity stats with great UI/UX.  We implemented ES6
classes and a testing suite using Test Driven Development to build our data
model. We implemented jQuery for our DOM manipulation and used eslint for
style guide accuracy.  This project was focused on clean, DRY code and SRP,
especially when building out the data model.

Currently our project generates a random number to serve as a user id, then
displays all activity information tied to that user.  Future iteration goals
would implement a login page to determine a specific user as well adding
customization to save the user's organization of the draggable widgets.

## Design

This project specified what information should be displayed but did not provide
a comp to match nor did it specify how any of the required information should be
displayed. We chose to mix up the display options and include an engaging color
scheme with great UI and readability in mind.
