## Project Details

This paired project was completed in 10 days at Turing School of Software and Design. The objective was to
build out a data model to process several data sets and then to create a dashboard displaying user activity stats with an interactive UI/UX using `Chart.js`. Currently the application generates a random number to serve as a user id, then displays all activity information tied to that user.  Future iteration goals would implement a login page to determine a specific user as well adding customization to save the user's organization of the draggable widgets.

## Goals:
1) Implemented ES6 classes 
2) Use Test Driven Development to build data model
3) Implemented `jQuery` for our DOM manipulation 
4) Implement `eslint` for style guide accuracy.  

This project was focused on clean, DRY code and SRP, especially when building out the data model.
